        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Máté Réthy, and I'm a frontend developer with a wide range of skills and experiences. During my time at university, I worked on several research projects where I gained proficiency in Matlab and Python, allowing me to improve my analytical and programming abilities. My love for development pushed me to complete a thesis project using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, further expanding my expertise in frontend technologies.

            At Gomeddo, I gained invaluable experience working with Salesforce, where I had the opportunity to observe the software development lifecycle. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and strive to produce quality work while paying attention to detail and maintaining a problem-solving mindset. With my diverse skill set and passion for frontend development, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to any project.</p>
